angular instructions

For our Angular application, we will want:

2 different pages (Home, Nerds)
A different Angular controller for each page (MainCtrl.js and NerdCtrl.js)
An Angular service for Nerds (Managing info presentations)
No page refresh when switching pages
Letâ€™s create the files needed for our Angular application. This will be done in public/js. Here is the application structure for our frontend:

- public 
    ----- js
    ---------- controllers 
    -------------------- MainCtrl.js
    -------------------- NerdCtrl.js
    ---------- services
    -------------------- NerdService.js
    ---------- app.js 
    ---------- appRoutes.js


Once we have created our controllers, services, and routes, we will combine them all and inject these modules into our main app.js file to get everything working together.
